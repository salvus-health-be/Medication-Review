# General Instructions
This is the Angular project. We also have a backend service in a separate repository. The frontend and backend communicate via REST APIs. Please ensure that any changes made in the frontend are compatible with the backend APIs. You can call the backend service at "http://localhost:7071/api" but this only applies to local development so please make it so we only need to change this URL in one place when deploying to production.
